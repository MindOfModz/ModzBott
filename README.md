### Clear parameters.
>As shows earlier in this document, the clear command is way more developed compared to all the other commands available. This is due to the amount of ways you can use the command. Hence why there is a section in this document talking about the parameters for the **clear command**.     
> **m/clear** - This is the basic command and removes 100 messages at a time.

> **m/<samp>[amount]clear </samp>**- Makes the bot remove as many messages as **you** want. This command is easy but a little more awkward comapred to **m/clear** as the wya it is was the only way it would work.       
<samp>Examples: </samp>       
>To clear 2 messages use **m/2clear**       
>To clear 5 messages use **m/5clear**       
>To clear 56 messages use **m/56clear**       

>This command allows you to clear up to 100 messages in this form.

> **m/autoclear** - This command makes the bot automatically clear messages from the channel the command was used in. However you will need another bot to do this. **Join the support server for details.**

> **m/<samp>[amount]autoclear </samp>** - Makes the bot automatically delete as many messages as **you** want.        
> **Just like the m/autoclear command, you will need another bot for this.**        
> **Join the support server for details.**

### Common Issues:
> **My bot is offline.** - If your bot is offline it is either because it timed out or because the host performed a restart.       
> if your bot is offline you **MUST** join the [support server](https://discord.gg/nzEnYtZ) and let the developer know.

> **The bot will not clear messages.** - If the bot does not clear messages make sure that is has the **<samp>MANAGE MESSAGES </samp>** permission. It needs this to function.

> **The auto clear is not working.** - If the auto clear is not working it could mean many things. It could mean that there is a bug in the code or insufficient permissions. Please refer to the [permissions](#Required-Permission:-MANAGE-MESSAGES) for details on what permission this needs.
