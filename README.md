# ModzBott
A place where all things to do with the ModzBott is found. Commands that require new contents will hopefully be updated regularly.

### Required Permission: <samp>MANAGE MESSAGES, READ MESSAGE HISTORY </samp>

>Helpful links: [Support Server](https://discord.gg/nzEnYtZ), [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Modzzzzz/ModzBott), [Discord Bot List](https://top.gg/bot/709030261605793803), [Website](https://ModzBottWebsite.lewisderek0508.repl.co)

### Available Commands:
##### m/hello
> Using this command will make the bot say hello back to you. Nothing too complicated.              
> <samp>To use this command just use **m/hello** </samp>
##### m/magicball
>This command gives you a random answer to any question you give.         
> <samp>To use this command use **m/magicball [question in here]** </samp>        
> **Do not put the brackets. It will not work.**
##### m/help
>This command sends an embed containing the GitHub Repository link, the top.gg link and the link to the support server.
> <samp>To use this command use **m/help**. </samp>       
> **This command sends the embed to the channel it is used in.**
##### m/coolcheck
>This command tells you how cool you really are. The output is random between 0% and 100%.        
> <samp>To use this command use **m/cookcheck**. </samp>        
> **Just like the help command, this command sends the output to the channel it is used in.**
##### m/invite
>Get an invite link to add the bot to your server.        
> **To use this command just say m/invite**.
##### m/autoclear
>Make the bot remove messages automatically. However, you will need another bot to do this. A more updated version is coming soon when the website is implemented. 
> **If you require support for this please join the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/nzEnYtZ)**
##### m/clear
>This command makes the bot remove 100 messages from the channel the command is used in. This command is way more developed compared to the others. Please refer to **[Clear Details](#clear-parameters)**
##### m/flipcoin
>This command will make the bot flip in imaginary coin and say the answer.
> **To use this command use m/flipcoin**        
> <samp>Possible outcomes: **Heads**, **Tails** </samp>
##### m/qpoll
>This command will make the bot add a tick, cross and question mark emoji to your message. Please make sure you put the question in ** ** to be sure people can read the question as it will not remove the command prefix.      
> **To use this command use m/commands**
##### m/whereami
>This command will send an embed containing all of the information of the server you are using the command in. It will supply you with the server name, member count and a channel and role count.

### Clear parameters.
>As shows earlier in this document, the clear command is way more developed compared to all the other commands available. This is due to the amount of ways you can use the command. Hence why there is a section in this document talking about the parameters for the **clear command**.     
> **m/clear** - This is the basic command and removes 100 messages at a time.

> **m/<samp>[amount]clear </samp>**- Makes the bot remove as many messages as **you** want. This command is easy but a little more awkward comapred to **m/clear** as the wya it is was the only way it would work.       
<samp>Examples: </samp>       
>To clear 2 messages use **m/2clear**       
>To clear 5 messages use **m/5clear**       
>To clear 56 messages use **m/56clear**       

>This command allows you to clear up to 100 messages in this form.

> **m/autoclear** - This command makes the bot automatically clear messages from the channel the command was used in. However you will need another bot to do this. **Join the support server for details.**

> **m/<samp>[amount]autoclear </samp>** - Makes the bot automatically delete as many messages as **you** want.        
> **Just like the m/autoclear command, you will need another bot for this.**        
> **Join the support server for details.**

### Common Issues:
> **My bot is offline.** - If your bot is offline it is either because it timed out or because the host performed a restart.       
> if your bot is offline you **MUST** join the [support server](https://discord.gg/nzEnYtZ) and let the developer know.

> **The bot will not clear messages.** - If the bot does not clear messages make sure that is has the **<samp>MANAGE MESSAGES </samp>** permission. It needs this to function.

> **The auto clear is not working.** - If the auto clear is not working it could mean many things. It could mean that there is a bug in the code or insufficient permissions. Please refer to the permissions (top of README.md) for details on what permission this needs. 

> **My money is not adding up or saving.** - Please let me know in the [support server](https://discord.gg/nzEnYtZ) so i can get a fix for that as soon as possible.

> **Why can i not self host this bot?** - Please be patient. Self hosting versions of this bot will soon be ready. Updates to this will come out whenever needed.
